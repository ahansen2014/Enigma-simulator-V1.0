# Enigma-simulator-V1.0
Python implementation of the WWII Enigma Simulator

This application is now fully functional and can encrypt / decrypt messages using the Enigma I / M3 version of the Enigma.  It cannot, as yet, handle the four rotor Kriegsmarine Enigma.

The code has been tested using these genuine Enigma intercepts: http://wiki.franklinheath.co.uk/index.php/Enigma/Sample_Messages and this Enigma simulator: https://piotte13.github.io/enigma-cipher/
